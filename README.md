# MedicineTrainProject
Just a train project

The database was hosted on localhost, access was passwordless, user 'root'.

Known Issues: 
1) Upload might not work, I only got it sent once during development
2) The text of the first paragraph of the main content does not wrap words on mobile resolution. css-styles known to me could not solve the problem
3) Perhaps I could have missed the difference in the font of the paragraphs
4) Did not solve the problem of images appearing in the slider only after the end of the scroll animation
